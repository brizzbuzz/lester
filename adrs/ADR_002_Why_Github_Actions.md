# What are GitHub Actions

Github Actions are Github's in-house CI/CD
pipeline solution

# What do they offer us?

They offer seamless integration into the various hooks 
that our project will need, mainly running automated tests
as part of the PR lifecycle, as well as building and 
publishing apps on release.

# What will it cost?

Currently, GitHub Actions are totally free for open source
projects!! 

# How to get started

There are already some examples from the Tauri team on
how to integrate GitHub actions into your project.  They are
stored [here](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action). 
Currently, Lester uses their publishing strategy to build
a versioned app on push to the release branch
